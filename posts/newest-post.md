Welcome to the blog section of my portfolio site, and the official first blog post! In the future, any blog posts that I write will be located in the **Blog** section. Additionally, the home page will showcase the three most recent posts available.

This is also serving as a placeholder blog post for development purposes. As you may expect, I need example content to test with so I can appropriately style these pages and tweak any data fetching logic as necessary.

This page is using a markdown compiler to render each individual blog post. This makes creating blog posts simple for me as I am able to quickly type them up in markdown!
